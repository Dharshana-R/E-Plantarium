    <h1 class="title">CHOLE BHATURE</h1><br><br><br>
    <p>Chole is the Indian name for chickpeas. Tossed in a savoury gravy and mixed with just the right spices, chickpeas get a new identity. This steamy gravy is the true soul mate for our Bhature. Made from white flour, commonly called Maida in India, Bhature is the heart and soul of this dish. This fried bread is cooked until it turns a lovely brown and gold. Soft and salty, the Bhature melt right in our mouths when eaten with Chole.<p>Alternative names:	Urad ki Dal, Mash ki Dal, Maa ki dal</p><br>
    <p>Region or staten : Punjab, India </p><br>
    <p>Created by: Kundan Lal Gujral, Kundan Lal Jaggi</p><br>
    <p>Main ingredients: urad dal (black gram)</p><br>
        <br>
         <h5 class="sub">History:</h5><br>
         <p>Dal makhani served with rice.
            Kundan Lal Jaggi had already invented the now world-famous Butter Chicken and was looking to create a vegetarian dish that would complement it. A regular diner at Moti Mahal, the restaurant that Jaggi ran with two other partners, suggested that something exciting should be created out of the maa ki dal.

        <h5 class="sub">Preparation:</h5><br><br>
         
        <p> Dal makhani is made using black lentils (urad dal) and red kidney beans (rajma) that have been soaked overnight. These are mixed with tomato puree, a selection of herbs and spices that include garam masala, sabzi masala, ginger-garlic paste, and a large amount of butter. The mix is left to cook overnight on a tandoor so the dal can get a distinct smoky flavor. The dal is served with a generous garnish of fresh butter.

            The rich dal is usually served with naan, boiled rice etc.
            
            Today, with modern devices like the pressure cooker, making dal makhani is not an elaborate time-consuming process; however, soaking the pulses is an unavoidable necessity. It is an age-old recipe with rich amounts of flavour in every bite.
