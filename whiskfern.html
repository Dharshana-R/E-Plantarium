    <h1 class="title">WHISK FERN</h1><br><br><br>

    <p>Whisk-fern is known as moa, skeleton, fork fern, and whisk fern, this plant is both rootless and leafless, forming low growing clumps. The plant produces abundant spores which are collected and used for making powder. In Greek, 'psilo' means bare. The scientific name reflects the plant's appearance where many of the organs which would normally present in a plant are absent in this one, including leaves, flowers, and roots. You can use the whisk fern as a small broom by tying a handful of its branches together.

        <p>If repotting divisions, keep them moist in shade for the first two weeks. 
        In humid areas or at specific times of the year, the plants are greener and more lush. </p>

        <h5 class="sub">Additional Habitat Information:</h5> <br>
        <p>Moa is a pantropical species found on all the Main Hawaiian Islands in dry to wet areas from near sea level to 4000 feet on rocks, lava flows, and as epiphytically on tree trunks and forks of branches. It can be weedy in urban areas growing in nearly every environment.
        A collection of Psilotum nudum made in 1923 from Midway Atoll was discovered in 2008 in the collections of the Herbarium Pacificum (Bishop Museum). 
    </p><br>
         
    <h5 class="sub">Special Features and Information:</h5><br>
         
       <p> General Information:
        Psilotum belong to the Whisk-fern family (Psilotaceae) with only two widespread<br>
         species: Psilotum complanatum and P. nudus. Both species are indigenous to the Hawaiian Islands.<br>
        Etymology:
        The generic name is from the Greek psilos, naked or smooth, alluding to the smooth aerial stems without leaves.
        The specific epithet  is from the Latin nudus, bare or naked, in reference to the naked nature of the stems.
        So then, the apparently redundant name Psilotum nudum refers to a really naked, naked plant!<br>
        Background Information:
        The two native species of moa (Psilotum spp.) can hybridize when found together.<br>
    </p> <br>
       <h5 class="sub"> Uses: </h5><br>
         
       <h5 class="sub">Medicinal: </h5><br>
       <p> Moa was used for constipation in newborn babies and elderly men and women. It was also mixed with other plants to treat  tuberculosis, consumption, and various respiratory conditions. Additionally, extracts from moa were used as laxatives. A tea, using the whole plant, was brewed and contains cathartic properties to purge the bowels. The spores were used for diarrhea in infants and used like talcum powder to prevent chafing from loincloths. 
       </p><br>
        <h5 class="sub">Modern Use: </h5><br>
       <p> Moa continues to be a part of modern lei making for the neck, head, wrist, ankle, and horse. <br>
        They can also be used in floral arrangement and have a vase life of a week or two.
